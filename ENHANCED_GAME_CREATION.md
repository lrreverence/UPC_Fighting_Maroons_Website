# Enhanced Game Creation Functionality - Testing Guide

## Overview
The FullSchedule component has been enhanced with team and player selection functionality. When creating a new game, users can now:

1. **Select a Team** from a dropdown of available teams
2. **Select Players** from that team to participate in the game
3. **Search Players** by name or student ID
4. **View Selected Players** with the ability to remove individual selections

## Features Implemented

### 1. Team Selection
- Dropdown shows all available teams from the database
- When a team is selected, the system automatically fetches athletes for that team

### 2. Player Selection
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Search players by name or student ID
- **Multiple Selection**: Select multiple players from the team
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected players are clearly marked with badges
- **Player Information**: Shows both name and student ID to avoid confusion

### 3. Database Integration
- **Game Creation**: Creates game record in the `game` table
- **Participation Tracking**: Creates records in `game_participation` table linking selected players to the game
- **Proper Error Handling**: Validates inputs and handles database errors

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during data fetching
- **Validation**: Prevents submission without required fields
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions

## Database Structure
